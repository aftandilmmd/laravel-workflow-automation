## Quick Overview

```php
use Aftandilmmd\WorkflowAutomation\Models\Workflow;

// 1. Create a workflow
$workflow = Workflow::create(['name' => 'Welcome Email']);

// 2. Add nodes
$trigger  = $workflow->addNode('Start', 'manual');
$sendMail = $workflow->addNode('Send Welcome', 'send_mail', [
    'to'      => '{{ item.email }}',
    'subject' => 'Welcome, {{ item.name }}!',
    'body'    => 'Thanks for joining us.',
]);

// 3. Connect & activate
$trigger->connect($sendMail);
$workflow->activate();

// 4. Run it
$run = $workflow->start([
    ['name' => 'Alice', 'email' => 'alice@example.com'],
]);
// $run->status === 'completed'
```
