# Why Use This?

## The Problem

Most Laravel apps start with automation logic baked directly into controllers, services, or event listeners:

```php
// Scattered across your codebase...
class OrderController {
    public function store(Request $request) {
        $order = Order::create($request->validated());

        // Send confirmation email
        Mail::to($order->user)->send(new OrderConfirmation($order));

        // Notify Slack
        Http::post('https://hooks.slack.com/...', ['text' => "New order #{$order->id}"]);

        // If high-value, notify manager
        if ($order->total > 1000) {
            Mail::to('manager@company.com')->send(new HighValueOrder($order));
        }

        // Log to analytics
        Http::post('https://analytics.example.com/events', [...]);

        return response()->json($order);
    }
}
```

This works — until it doesn't:

- **Every change requires a developer.** Product wants to add a "send SMS for orders over $500" step? That's a code change, PR, review, deploy.
- **Logic is invisible.** No one can see the full automation flow without reading code. Non-technical team members are locked out.
- **No observability.** When the Slack notification fails, you find out from a user complaint, not a dashboard.
- **Tightly coupled.** The controller now knows about emails, Slack, analytics, and business rules. Testing and refactoring become painful.
- **AI can't help.** An AI agent can't safely modify your controller logic — one wrong edit could break your checkout flow.

## The Solution

Laravel Workflow Automation separates your automation logic from your application code. Instead of writing automation in PHP, you **compose workflows from reusable nodes** — either through the visual editor or the REST API.

Your controller becomes clean:

```php
class OrderController {
    public function store(Request $request) {
        $order = Order::create($request->validated());
        return response()->json($order);
    }
}
```

The automation moves into a workflow — created once via PHP, the visual editor, or the REST API:

```php
$workflow = Workflow::create(['name' => 'Order Automation']);

// Trigger: fires when an Order is created
$trigger = $workflow->addNode('Order Created', 'model_event', [
    'model' => Order::class,
    'event' => ['created'],
]);

// Send confirmation email
$confirm = $workflow->addNode('Confirmation Email', 'send_mail', [
    'to'      => '{{ item.user.email }}',
    'subject' => 'Order #{{ item.id }} confirmed',
    'body'    => 'Thanks for your order!',
]);

// Notify Slack
$slack = $workflow->addNode('Slack Notify', 'http_request', [
    'url'    => 'https://hooks.slack.com/...',
    'method' => 'POST',
    'body'   => '{"text": "New order #{{ item.id }} — ${{ item.total }}"}',
]);

// Check if high-value
$check = $workflow->addNode('High Value?', 'if_condition', [
    'field'    => '{{ item.total }}',
    'operator' => '>',
    'value'    => '1000',
]);

// Notify manager for high-value orders
$manager = $workflow->addNode('Notify Manager', 'send_mail', [
    'to'      => 'manager@company.com',
    'subject' => 'High-value order #{{ item.id }}',
    'body'    => 'Order total: ${{ item.total }}',
]);

// Log to analytics
$analytics = $workflow->addNode('Analytics', 'http_request', [
    'url'    => 'https://analytics.example.com/events',
    'method' => 'POST',
    'body'   => '{"event": "order", "id": {{ item.id }}}',
]);

// Connect the flow
$trigger->connect($confirm);
$confirm->connect($slack);
$slack->connect($check);
$check->connect($manager, 'true');   // high-value path
$check->connect($analytics, 'false'); // normal path
$manager->connect($analytics);

$workflow->activate();
```

Same behavior, but now it's **visible**, **editable**, **observable**, and **manageable** — without touching the controller again.

## Key Benefits

### AI-Agent Friendly

The package exposes a complete REST API for workflow management. AI agents can:

- Create workflows (`POST /workflows`)
- Add and connect nodes (`POST /workflows/{id}/nodes`, `POST /workflows/{id}/edges`)
- Configure node behavior (`PUT /workflows/{id}/nodes/{id}`)
- Execute and monitor runs (`POST /workflows/{id}/run`, `GET /runs/{id}`)

This means an AI agent can **modify your application's behavior** without editing a single PHP file. The agent works within a safe, bounded interface — it can only compose workflows from registered node types, never execute arbitrary code in your core.

### No-Code Scenarios

The built-in [visual editor](/ui-editor) lets non-technical team members build and modify workflows directly:

- Drag nodes onto a canvas
- Connect them visually
- Configure each node through dynamic forms
- Test with real data and see results immediately

New business rule? New workflow — zero deployments, zero developer time.

### Core Stays Clean

Workflows live entirely outside your application code:

| Traditional | With Workflow Automation |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Logic in controllers, services, listeners | Logic in workflow definitions (database) |
| Change = code edit + PR + deploy | Change = edit workflow in UI or API |
| Disable = comment out code | Disable = toggle workflow off |
| Rollback = git revert + deploy | Rollback = deactivate or delete workflow |

Your models, controllers, and routes stay focused on their primary responsibility.

### Full Observability

Every workflow execution is recorded with:

- **Per-node status** — completed, failed, running, skipped
- **Input/output data** — full JSON for every node in the chain
- **Duration** — how long each node took
- **Error details** — exact error messages for failed nodes
- **Replay** — re-execute any run with the same or modified payload

No more guessing why an email didn't send or which step in the chain failed.

### Extensible

Adding a custom node is one PHP class:

```php
#[AsWorkflowNode(
    key: 'notify_crm',
    name: 'Notify CRM',
    type: NodeType::Action,
)]
class NotifyCrmNode extends BaseNode
{
    public function execute(WorkflowNodeRun $nodeRun, array $input): array
    {
        $response = Http::post('https://crm.example.com/api/events', [
            'event' => $this->config('event_type'),
            'data'  => $input['item'],
        ]);

        return ['crm_response' => $response->json()];
    }
}
```

Once created, it's automatically available in the visual editor, REST API, and node registry. Internal APIs, domain-specific logic, third-party integrations — all become reusable building blocks.

## AI Agents as First-Class Citizens

This is where the package opens a fundamentally new door. Consider what happens when you give an AI agent access to the workflow API:

**Traditional approach:** You ask an AI agent to add a feature to your app. The agent needs to understand your codebase, find the right files, write PHP code, and hope it doesn't break anything.

**With Workflow Automation:** The agent doesn't touch your code at all. It creates a workflow through the REST API:

```
Agent receives: "When a customer signs up, wait 3 days,
                 check if they've used the product,
                 and send an onboarding or reminder email."

Agent executes:
  1. POST /workflows                        → Create "Onboarding Flow"
  2. POST /workflows/1/nodes                → Add Model Event Trigger (User created)
  3. POST /workflows/1/nodes                → Add Delay node (3 days)
  4. POST /workflows/1/nodes                → Add HTTP Request (check usage API)
  5. POST /workflows/1/nodes                → Add IF Condition (has_usage == true)
  6. POST /workflows/1/nodes                → Add Send Mail (onboarding)
  7. POST /workflows/1/nodes                → Add Send Mail (reminder)
  8. POST /workflows/1/edges                → Connect all nodes
  9. POST /workflows/1/activate             → Go live
```

No PHP files opened. No deploy needed. And if it's wrong:
- **Safe** — The agent can only use registered node types, never arbitrary code
- **Bounded** — It operates through the API, not your filesystem
- **Reversible** — Deactivate or delete the workflow, app returns to normal
- **Auditable** — Every run is logged with full input/output

│                    → Send Mail (offboarding)
│
└  Done
```

## When to Use

**Good fit:**

- Automation flows that change frequently (marketing campaigns, notification rules, onboarding sequences)
- Processes that non-technical team members need to manage
- AI-driven scenarios where agents need to create or modify app behavior
- Multi-step processes with conditions, delays, and external API calls
- Anything that needs full execution logging and replay capability

**Not the right fit:**

- Core business logic that rarely changes and is performance-critical (use plain PHP)
- Simple one-off tasks (a single Artisan command is simpler)
- Real-time, sub-millisecond processing (workflows add overhead from graph traversal and logging)
